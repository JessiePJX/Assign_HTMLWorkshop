      22 is the deuteragonist of Disney/Pixar's 2020 animated feature film, <a href="https://movies.disney.com/soul">Soul</a>
      </p>

    <p>
      22 has spent hundreds of years at The You Seminar, where new souls must meet several requirements before going to Earth. 
      Like every soul before her, 22 has been through the Personality Pavilions, which explains her endearing sarcasm, quick wit and occasional moodiness. 
      She’s met every requirement to go to Earth—except one. 
      But no matter how many visits she makes to the Hall of Everything, no matter how many esteemed luminaries have mentored her, she can’t find the spark she needs to fulfill her requirements and make her way to Earth. 
      That’s fine with 22; the truth is—she’s not interested in life on Earth at all. <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/22">(22 | Disney Wiki | Fandom)</a>
      </p>

    <p>
      After accidentally switching her soul with Joe and living her life on Earth for one day, 22 fills the last requirement for the Personality Pavilions. 
      She has fould her spark without Joe and herself noticing how. 
      </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Her spark is her love of just simply living.</b>
